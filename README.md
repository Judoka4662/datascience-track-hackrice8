# DataScienceTrack
HackRice 7.5 - Data Science Track

## Introduction

Have you ever looked for shoes online and found related advertisements on facebook and other websites continuously for a week? Or say, youâ€™re chatting with your best friend and the keyboard suggests you the exact words that you want to use in your sentence? How does YouTube show all your favourite videos on your homescreen?

Well these are all the applications of Data Science. Over the last few years Data Science has really changed our concept of technology. Our lives are a lot easier as compared to 10yrs ago, and this is all because of data science. Data Science has really pulled the ends between fiction and technology. Right from LinkedIn to Tinder, data science is being used everywhere.

This tutorial will give you a brief introduction into some basic applications of machine learning and data science along with example prompts to compete in this track. To compete though, any data science project will do.

## Tools needed

Tools We Need
This tutorial requires Python and JuPyter Notebook. To run our Python code we need:

* Either [Python 2 or 3](https://www.fullstackpython.com/python-2-or-3.html) (Python 2 must be at least version 2.7.9, Windows will require python3)
* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) and
  [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) to handle Python
  
  
If you do not have python currently, we suggest installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (use the python3 version) since it includes almost everything we need.

In addition, Windows users will need To install Cygwin (more on this below).

### Cygwin installation (Windows users only)

Visit [this website](https://cygwin.com/install.html) to install Cygwin.  For each screen on the installer where it provides a default option, the default is fine.  However, there is one screen that asks you to "Choose A Download Site".  Any site should work; however, some work better than others.  'https://mirror.steadfast.net' works well.

### Pip installation
If you don't already have pip installed, we'll go ahead an install that now because it will be essential 
for the rest of the project. 

Visit [this website](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) to install pip. Follow the instructions, and once you 
think you're done, type `which pip` to check that pip has been installed. You should see the version number of the pip 
you installed print to your terminal.

## Establishing your environment

### Using Virtualenv

We now know what tools we need for our project so let's get our development
environment set up. Go to the terminal (or Cygwin on Windows) and
change into the directory where you want to store this project. Within
that directory, create a new virtualenv to isolate our application
dependencies from other Python projects.

    virtualenv datascience

Activate the virtualenv (Mac/Linux):

    source datascience/bin/activate

Activate the virtualenv (Windows):

    source datascience/Scripts/activate

### Using Anaconda

If you're using Anaconda this is prett easy. Simply run

```
conda create --name datascience
```
Activate the virtualenv:

```
source activate datascience
```

### Installing necessary packages
