# DataScienceTrack
HackRice 7.5 - Data Science Track

## Introduction

Have you ever looked for shoes online and found related advertisements on facebook and other websites continuously for a week? Or say, youâ€™re chatting with your best friend and the keyboard suggests you the exact words that you want to use in your sentence? How does YouTube show all your favourite videos on your homescreen?

Well these are all the applications of Data Science. Over the last few years Data Science has really changed our concept of technology. Our lives are a lot easier as compared to 10yrs ago, and this is all because of data science. Data Science has really pulled the ends between fiction and technology. Right from LinkedIn to Tinder, data science is being used everywhere.

This tutorial will give you a brief introduction into some basic applications of machine learning and data science along with example prompts to compete in this track. To compete though, any data science project will do.

## Tools needed

Tools We Need
Our bot, which we will name "StarterBot", requires Python and the Slack API. To run our Python code we need:

* Either [Python 2 or 3](https://www.fullstackpython.com/python-2-or-3.html) (Python 2 must be at least version 2.7.9)
* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) and
  [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) to handle Python
  [application dependencies](https://www.fullstackpython.com/application-dependencies.html)
* [Free Slack account](https://slack.com/) - you need to be signed into at
  least one workspace where you have access to building apps.
  
In addition, Windows users will need To install Cygwin (more on this below).

It is also useful to have the Slack API docs handy while you're building this tutorial.
All the code for this tutorial is available open source under the MIT license in the slack-starterbot public repository.
